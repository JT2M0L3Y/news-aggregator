### Description

This project is a website that allows members to filter a news feed to only see content from sources and topics they want to see. 
The goal here is to reduce online surfing time for web visitors to find what news they want to see.

### Installation

Currently, there are no npm packages needed to run this project as it is just front-end development. 
Also, I have included my API key to the news API I used. This key allows for 200 requests per day.

### Usage

At this moment, one of the important features of this project is the search bar (although it requires terms  
listed among the articles that show up, which is a problem because most news provided by the API has been  
random). The other important feature is the ability to add/remove articles with the 'My List' page. But,  
this only works for adding individual articles.
