### Installation

Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. 
Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

<a name="use"></a>
### Usage

The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed 
it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

<a name="cont"></a>
### Contributing

Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. 
Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers 
know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for 
setting guidelines for repository contributors.

<a name="cred"></a>
### Credits

Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

<a name="licence"></a>
### License

Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, 
check out [GitHub’s licensing guide](https://choosealicense.com/)
